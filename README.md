### Supervisor Scraping Scripts

This repository contains some Python scripts for scraping faculty and supervisor information from university websites. The scripts are designed to extract publicly available data such as names, emails, and research areas, and store them in structured CSV files for my convenience. I am preparing for a research based masters at the moment. 

#### Features

- Scrape supervisor/faculty information from multiple universities.
- Store the scraped data in CSV files for easy analysis.
- Modular scripts: each script targets a specific university website.
- Handles basic data cleaning and formatting.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas` (optional, for advanced CSV handling)

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
